    <h1>Who imagines, builds and launches rockets?</h1>
    <section class="intro">Space is not an easy goel. Gravity and air resistance are two factors that greatly inder the launch of objects
    in space and makes mandatory the use of cutting edge and always more powerful motors. Creating such machines is no
    child's play and each year the budjets for the agencies and companies whose goal is to break the limit of
    accessible and exploitable territory get larger. As the planet struggles more and more to support human life,
    space might be help us find solutions be it on our planet our far in the solar system. <br> Discover those who might
    make this dream come true:

            The National Aeronautics and Space Administration or NASA, is one of the biggest space agency in the world, they are considered
            a reference on the subject of space. From 1958 to nowadays, they keep experimenting, trying and thinking of ways to
            go to space farther, faster and cheaper. They fund promising projects from private companies and associate with them so that space
            conquering is no longer a dream.

            Third biggest spatial agency after the NASA and the chinese one, the esa is an intergovernmental agency in which
            european countries such as France, Germany, Italy and more gather in order to have their own spatial program able to
            be equal to the biggest ones. As many others, their mission is to research, create and launch missions, they do so thanks
            to the Ariane launcher series from the base of Kourou in French Guiana. The current Ariane launcher is Ariane 5, to be
            replaced by Ariane 6 by late 2022

            Also known as Roscosmos, it is the state company in charge of the russian spatial program. From USSR during the cold war to Russia
            nowadays, they work under the government independently from others to create their own launchers. However
            there still are collaborations as we can see with the ISS which was a program done with the NASA, the esa and more.
            Their launcher Soyouz is one of the few to launch crews to the ISS.

            Created by the billionaire Elon Musk in 2002, SpaceX is one of the rare private companies in this field of activity.
            they are known for the Falcon series that are reusable launchers, disminishing the cost of production by a huge amount compared to
            traditional rockets. NASA itself signed a contract with spacex to transport astronauts to the ISS.

            Created by Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, blue origin integrated the Commercial Crew Development of NASA
            to improve crew transportation means to the ISS. Their main goal is develop spacial tourism by making possible for the greatest number
            to travel to space. Bezos hopes to create a way to reduce costs so that the activities stressing earth can be moved to space.
