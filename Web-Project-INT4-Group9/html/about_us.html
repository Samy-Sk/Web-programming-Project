    We decided to create this website after seeing how much spacial programes are known about (spoilers, not that much). Sure each major event like the first retrieval of Falcon 9 by Spacex
    is highly talked about on social medias but do you consider yourself to know a lot about rockets and space? If the answer is no then congratulations you are exactly the kind of persons
    we want to see this site. If you are curious about space, we invite you to take a look around here, you might learn things.
    <br><br>
    Thanks to Samy, who coded and decorated it, we also added a shop so you can buy goods on the theme of space.<br>
    Yani was in charge of the Login page, the Main page, footer and header. <br>
    And myself, Julian, created the actors page as well as this one.
